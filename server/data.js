        info: "Kepa Arrizabalaga signed for Chelsea from Athletic Bilbao on 8 August 2018 The 23-year-old Spanish international goalkeeper arrived ahead of the 2018/19 Premier League season having signed a seven-year contract at Stamford Bridge. Kepa, who has played over 100 career league games, has solid experience at the highest level having made more than 50 appearances in La Liga, his quality earning him a call-up to the Spain squad for this summer’s World Cup in Russia. Upon completing his move to Chelsea, he said: ‘It’s a very important decision for me, for my career, and also for my personal life. 'So many things attracted me to the club, all the titles the club has won, the other players, the city, the English Premier League. It’s an accumulation of things, and I am very glad Chelsea has decided to trust me and to take me in as well.’ Director Marina Granovskaia added: ‘Kepa is a talent we have admired for a long time and we are extremely excited about his arrival. He has already demonstrated fantastic quality and consistency and will be a big part of any success Chelsea have in the coming years. His long-term contract reflects the belief we have in him and we look ahead to the coming seasons with an enormous sense of optimism.’",

        info: "Goalkeeper Willy Caballero joined Chelsea on 1 July 2017 having been out of contract at Manchester City. He was signed to add strength to our goalkeeper resources following the departure of Asmir Begovic to Bournemouth as he has a wealth of experience at the highest level. He spent the previous three seasons at City, having started his career at Boca Juniors in his native Argentina before playing for Spanish clubs Elche and Malaga. Caballero moved to the Premier League in the summer of 2014, linking up once again with Manuel Pellegrini, whom he had played under at Malaga. The highlight of his time at City was the 2016 League Cup final when his heroics during the decisive penalty shoot-out against Liverpool ensured City secured the trophy. Caballero saved three penalties - from Lucas, Philippe Coutinho and Adam Lallana - as his team came out on top at Wembley.  In the 2016/17 season he featured in a memorable 3-1 Champions League win over Barcelona, and made a crucial penalty save from former Chelsea striker Falcao in the first leg of their last-16 knockout tie against Monaco. Caballero featured regularly towards the end of the campaign, including in City's 2-1 defeat at Stamford Bridge. On that night he saved an Eden Hazard penalty, only for the Belgian to tap home the rebound for what proved to be the winning goal.",

He wasted little time in displaying his composure and assuredness at the heart of defence for our youth team, impressing enough to earn himself an Under-21 debut before Christmas; however it was in the FA Youth Cup where he most grabbed attention. He scored the first goal in the fourth round at the Valley to inspire a fightback against Charlton after the Under-18s had fallen 2-0 behind, and played in all but two of the ties en route to the final. His total of 11 Under-21 appearances for the season underlined a level of maturity in his play beyond his years, and he made his European debut in the NextGen Series for Under-19s in a defensive midfield role against Ajax in December 2012. Christensen’s impressive first campaign earned him a spot on the bench for the final game of the season against Everton and, while he didn’t enter the fray to make a senior appearance, he was involved in a post-season tour to the USA. After signing a professional contract in the summer, he spent 2013/14 working predominantly with Dermot Drummy’s Under-21 group, featuring on 25 occasions as they topped the table and then won the league play-offs. He scored his first Under-21 goal in a 2-1 win over Manchester City in October and started every FA Youth Cup tie from the fifth round onwards as Adi Viveash’s youngsters won a memorable final against Fulham.Having played throughout the senior squad's pre-season, he was named as a member of Jose Mourinho's squad for the 2014/15 campaign and made his Chelsea debut in our fourth round Capital One Cup victory at Shrewsbury (below), playing the full 90 minutes at right-back and performed a similar role in the FA Cup fourth round against Bradford. Christensen was also part of the Under-19 side which won the UEFA Youth League in April 2015 and he had his first taste of Premier League football as a late sub against Sunderland at the end of the season.",

He had initially signed for the Blues on deadline day in January 2011 from Portuguese club Benfica. A 6ft 2in centre-back who can cover at either left- or right-back, and midfield, he is renowned for his skill on the ball as much as his defensive ability. He won plenty of plaudits for his early showings, and although he conceded a late penalty on his first start against Fulham, saved by Petr Cech, he went on to win the man of the match award. Ineligible for the Champions League, he retained his place in the Premier League side until a goal conceded in the opening seconds at Old Trafford torpedoed Chelsea's title chances and Carlo Ancelotti left the Brazilian out of the remaining games.

The Italian international, who can play at wing-back or full-back, signed a four-year deal at Stamford Bridge. Zappacosta possesses a combination of defensive and attacking qualities and is a fine crosser of the ball from a wide-right position. His energy and stamina enable him to get forward for 90 minutes and recover quickly when defending. He is quick and composed in one-on-one situations and times his tackles well.  He began his career at Italian fourth-tier side Isola Liri. After signing for Atalanta in Serie A, he then enjoyed regular first team football with Avellino, who purchased co-ownership rights to the player. He returned to Atalanta and became a regular there in 2014/15, with his performances earning him a move to Torino, one of the historically most successful clubs in Italy.  An impressive season in Turin led to Antonio Conte calling up Zappacosta to the Italy national squad ahead of Euro 2016, and he was named on their back-up list for the tournament. He subsequently made his maiden international appearance during the 2016/17 season and had been capped four times by the Azzurri at the time of his Chelsea signing.He quickly made an impact at Stamford Bridge. Having made his debut as a substitute in a win at Leicester in early September 2017, he scored a spectacular goal at home a few days later on his first start, finding the Qarabag net in the Champions League from out wide after a storming run down the wing.",

On signing a five-year contract, the player said: ‘I am absolutely ecstatic to be here at Chelsea. It is not easy to become part of such a big team so I am very, very happy. I am excited to play in such an intense league, for a team that gives everything to play and win.’ From his position as a deep-lying playmaker in a midfield trio, Jorginho was a vital cog in Sarri’s Napoli. Jorginho is a highly technical footballer capable of dictating the tempo of play in possession with quick passing and movement. In Naples, his ability to link defence and attack stood out. Indeed, in Europe’s big five leagues in the 2017/18 season, no player had more touches of the ball per minute than Jorginho. Alongside his technical qualities, he is a combative player willing to put his foot in to regain possession, and his positioning without the ball further aids his effectiveness in front of the defence. At the age of 15, Jorginho moved from Brazil, the country of his birth, to Italy, qualifying for citizenship there through his grandparents. He began his senior career at Verona, where he broke into the first team following a successful loan spell at lower-league side Sambonifacese. He was a regular as they won promotion to Serie A after an 11-year absence. In January 2014, Jorginho joined Napoli. He enjoyed four-and-a-half excellent years at the San Paolo, where he won the Coppa Italia and the Italian Super Cup, featuring prominently as they consistently challenged for the title and lit up Europe in the Champions League. Jorginho adapted quickly to the demands of English football and scored a goal on his Premier League debut, converting from the penalty spot in our 3-0 win at Huddersfield. His importance to Sarri's system quickly became apparent given Jorginho's ability to retain possession and use the ball intelligently, and he was a regular throughout the first half of the 2018/19 season.",

The Dutch international, who is 6ft 1in tall, has built a reputation for good energy, ball control and passing in central midfield, both as an attacking force or in a more defensive role.An anterior cruciate ligament injury, picked up in a Capital One Cup game early in his first campaign, halted what had been a promising start to the youngster’s Chelsea career. After working hard on his rehabilitation, he re-joined the squad in early March 2014 and spent the following season on loan at AC Milan.",

Kante joined from Leicester City, where he so memorably played a major part in the Foxes’ Premier League triumph the previous season. The then 25-year-old came close to adding to that success on the international stage soon after. He was part of the France squad that was denied a host-team triumph at Euro 2016 by an extra-time Portugal goal in the final. He arrived at Chelsea with a Premier League winners’ medal and eight international caps to his name, and was selected for the first game of the 2015/16 season, a win at home to West Ham.Picking up where he had left off at Leicester, Kante was a mainstay of Antonio Conte's team in the first half of the campaign, memorably scoring the fourth and final goal in a big win over Manchester United in October 2016.A match that typified his energy and contribution was an away draw at Anfield in January 2017 when he won a remarkable 14 tackles out of the 16 he went in for.

Barkley arrived with a wealth of experience for a player so young, having already made 150 Premier League appearances for Everton, as well as being named in England squads for both the World Cup and European Championships. His versatility ensures he can play just behind the striker, in a deeper midfield role or in an advanced wide position, with his ability to get on the ball and create chances one of the player’s biggest strengths. Barkley joined Everton at the age of 11 and quickly caught the eye due to his strength, desire and outstanding technical qualities. His Everton debut arrived on the opening day of the 2011/12 campaign and early on in his career he also spent time on loan at Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds United. Barkley scored his first Everton goal on the opening day of the 2013/14 season and after being given a key role in the Toffees’ midfield, the consistency and quality of his displays ensured he was named in the England squad for the World Cup in Brazil that summer.",

He captained England schoolboys in the Under-16s’ Victory Shield and played three times for the Chelsea youth team while still an Under-15. In 2011/12, while still a schoolboy, he was impressing again before picking up an injury to his hip and groin but recovered in time to make a substitute appearance in the FA Youth Cup final. His debut season as a full-time scholar saw him feature on 18 occasions for the Under-18s and net his first goal on the opening day of the campaign against Manchester City. He also made nine appearances for the Under-21s. His influence in midfield was vital as the Under-18s reached the Youth Cup final once again and he started the final three games of the NextGen Series campaign as the Under-19s lost 2-0 to Aston Villa in the final. His strong form was rewarded as he was selected to travel with the first team squad on a post-season trip in May 2013 to the US for two matches against Manchester City. The youngster started both games, impressing in the first before being replaced by Nathan Ake late on, and again starting the second game in promising fashion before being forced out of the action with an injury. In 2013/14 he was part of the Under-21 squad which lifted the Premier League title, as well as captaining our Under-18s to FA Youth Cup glory.",

He is a very talented, skilful individual who can play in any of the attacking positions. A regular with our youth team in the 2016/17 season, he played a key role in our Treble-winning success at that level that year, including goals in the fifth round, semi-final and final of the FA Youth Cup. Although still a schoolboy, he represented England Under-17s at the 2017 European Championship for that age group, scoring in the final as the young Lions were ultimately beaten on penalties by Spain. Later in the year, he featured at the Under-17 World Cup as England inflicted revenge by going all the way and beating Spain 5-2 in the final. Hudson-Odoi featured in every game at the tournament and assisted three goals against the Spanish to add another medal to his 2017 collection. In January 2018, he made his senior Chelsea debut when he came on in an FA Cup win over Newcastle United and he made a further three sub appearances that season, including his first in the Premier League in a home match against Bournemouth. He also helped our development squad to the semi-finals of the Checkatrade Trophy and the Under-18s to another FA Youth Cup. He scored twice in the final. Having impressed during pre-season in the summer of 2018,  including starting the Community Shield against Manchester City, new boss Maurizio Sarri confirmed the teenager would be part of his squad for the current campaign. After a couple of substitute appearances in the Europa League, he then started the game against PAOK Salonika and capped an impressive performance by scoring his first Chelsea goal in the second half.",

        info: "Eden Hazard agreed terms to sign for Chelsea in June 2012 from French club Lille, where he had played since 2005, and he became the fourth Belgian to join the club following the arrivals of Thibaut Courtois, Romelu Lukaku and Kevin De Bruyne. A double player of the year in France’s Ligue 1, and one of the most highly-coveted players in Europe at the time he joined the Blues, expectations were understandably high for Hazard’s first season in London. A nomination for the PFA Player of the Year and Young Player of the Year award, as well as a place in the Premier League Team of the Season, showed he had matched those expectations, and more. Quick, direct and skillful, Hazard is at his best running at defenders. Equally adept with either foot, the Belgian’s close control while carrying the ball at speed gives him regular scoring and creating opportunities, as demonstrated by his 13 goals and 25 assists in the 2012/13 campaign. His second season at the Bridge was even more successful as he finished as the club's top scorer and won the club's Player of the Year award, as well as the PFA Young Player of the Year award. Matters got even better in a spectacular third year which ended with five high-profile individual accolades, the Premier League title and the Capital One Cup. The 2015/16 season fared less well but the Belgian was back to his best in 2016/17, again named Chelsea Player of the Year as he inspired to team to another league title. Hazard is well-established as one of the stars of the Premier League and he captains his national side.",

        info: "Gonzalo Higuain joined Chelsea on January 24 initially on loan for the remainder of the 2018/19 season. The 31-year-old striker moved to Stamford Bridge from Italian side Juventus. He spent the first half of the campaign on loan at AC Milan where he scored eight goals. A proven goalscorer throughout his career, and an Argentina international, Higuain arrives with a wealth of experience at the highest level having consistently shown his attacking quality during spells in Argentina, Spain and Italy. Clinical in and around the penalty area, as well as providing a strong aerial threat, Higuain previously played under Maurizio Sarri at Napoli in 2015/16, when he finished as top scorer in Serie A with 36 goals, breaking a long-standing Serie A record. Upon completing his loan move to Chelsea, Higuain, who will wear the number nine shirt, said: ‘When the opportunity to join Chelsea presented itself I had to take it. It’s a team I’ve always liked that has a lot of history, a wonderful stadium and they play in the Premier League, a league I’ve always wanted to play in. ‘I now hope I can give back that trust Chelsea have shown me out on the pitch. I can’t wait to start and I hope to adapt as soon as possible.’ Director Marina Granovskaia added: ‘Gonzalo was our number one target in this transfer window and arrives with a proven record at the highest level. He has previously worked with Maurizio to great effect and is familiar with how the coach likes to play. ‘This was not an easy deal for us to do because of the numerous parties involved, but we are delighted we were able to make it happen and we look forward to seeing the impact Gonzalo will make for us in the second half of the season.’ Named in the Serie A Team of the Year on three separate occasions, Higuain backs his personal achievements up with collective honours. A title winner with Real Madrid and Juventus, he has also won domestic cup competitions with both teams, as well as being part of the Napoli side which won the Italian Cup in 2013/14. On the international stage, meanwhile, Higuain has represented Argentina at three World Cups and started the final against Germany in 2014.",

        info: "Olivier Giroud moved across London to Chelsea from Arsenal in January 2018 and signed an 18-month contract at Stamford Bridge. The striker arrived with a proven pedigree at the highest level having scored goals regularly in the Premier League, in Europe and on the international stage for France. A strong, physical forward, Giroud is lethal in the air and clinical with his feet in and around the penalty area. Giroud began his career with Grenoble and, after moving up through the ranks, eventually made his first-team debut for the French club in 2006. A loan spell at Istres followed before he joined Ligue 2 club Tours on a permanent basis. So impressive were his displays for Tours, Giroud then moved to Montpellier, in the French top flight, in July 2010. The striker made a goalscoring debut for Montpellier and enjoyed a solid first season with the club, scoring both goals in a 2-2 draw at PSG, as well as netting the winner against the same opposition in a League Cup semi-final. His second campaign at the club really could not have gone any better, with the forward netting hat-tricks in matches against Dijon and Sochaux as well as the winning goals against Lyon, Nice and St-Etienne as Montpellier won the French title for the first time in their history. He ended the campaign with 21 league goals. After signing for Arsenal in the summer of 2012, Giroud quickly adapted to the demands of English football. He ended the 2013/14 and 2014/15 seasons by playing in victorious FA Cup finals and in the second of those – a 4-0 win over Aston Villa – it was Giroud who completed the scoring.",

        info: "A talented two-footed winger, who is also capable of playing more centrally, Pedro arrived at Stamford Bridge with a fantastic pedigree having already enjoyed success at the highest level at club and international level, which he added to as a Blues player. He made his Chelsea debut away at West Bromwich Albion in August 2015 and endeared himself to supporters immediately, scoring one and laying on another in a 3-2 victory. He scored his first Premier League goal at home to Sunderland in December 2015, the first game after the departure of Jose Mourinho as manager. Pedro found good form in the latter months of the season despite some niggling injuries, and recorded two-goal hauls at home to Newcastle and away to Aston Villa, followed by a fine opener in a big win at Bournemouth. He finished joint-third highest scorer with eight goals from the 40 appearances of his maiden season. In October 2016, early in his second season at Chelsea, he scored the fastest goal of that campaign so far when netting after 30 seconds of a 4-0 win over Manchester United. It was also his 50th Chelsea appearance and began a run of scoring form which included the Premier League's Goal of the Month for November 2016, a turn and spectacular curled finish that equalised in a win at home to Spurs. Pedro's best form since arriving at the club frequently won him selection ahead of the previous season's Player of the Year Willian, and in the FA Cup, as a left wing-back and a right wing-back. He found the target five times in six games at the turn of the year.",

His choice of Stamford Bridge, and not White Hart Lane, as had been expected, immediately endeared the likeable Brazilian to the club’s supporters, who had a song penned for him even before he made his debut for the club. Comfortable operating in any of the attacking midfield positions behind the main striker, Willian is quick, robust and creative in possession. As his first couple of Chelsea goals proved, he also has an eye for the spectacular and he has emerged as one of the game's best set-piece specialists. His direct free-kicks were a major feature of the 2015/16 season when he shone brightly in a gloomy campaign in general. It was no surprise when Willian was both the fans and his team-mates' choice for Chelsea Player of the Year.",
